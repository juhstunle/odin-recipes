			<p><h2>Vietnamese Yellow Pancakes W/Fish Sauce</h2></p>
			Banh xeo (bahn SAY-oh) is a popular street snack in Vietnam, especially in the south. 
			The name means sound crepe, and refers to the sound the batter makes when it hits the hot 
			skillet. Serve with fresh herbs. The shrimp-studded crepe is rolled up in a leaf of lettuce 
			and dipped in nuoc cham dipping sauce before it gets popped in your mouth.
			<p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
			<ul>
				<li>1 cup rice flour</li>
				<li>1/2 tsp white sugar</li>
				<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
				<li>1/4 tsp ground tumeric</li>
				<li>1/2 cup water</li>
			</ul>

			<p><h2>Steps:</h2></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Mix rice flour, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and turmeric together in a large bowl.
				Beat in coconut milk to make a thick batter. Slowly beat in water until batter is 
				the consistency of a thin crepe batter.</li>
				<li>Heat 1 1/2 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallot 
				and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant but not browning, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 
				shrimp; saute until cooked through and opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with fish 
				sauce and salt. Transfer filling to a bowl.</li>
				<li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
				<li>Wipe out skillet and reheat over medium heat. Add remaining 1 1/2 teaspoon oil. 
				Stir crepe batter and pour 1/2 cup into the hot skillet, swirling to coat the 
				bottom. Lay 3 or 4 of the cooked shrimp on the bottom half of the crepe. Top with a 
				small handful of bean sprouts. Cook until batter looks set and edges start to brown, 
				about 1 minute. Fold crepe over and slide onto an oven-safe plate.</li>
				<li>Place crepe in the preheated oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter and 
				filling.</li>
			</ol>
